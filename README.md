# CV
This project is a small demo of Java code. Its purpose is to create a tool to generate my résumé (CV) from a single JSON data source, into various rendering formats.

It's an opportunity to provide some actual code with the CV, so that people can evaluate if my professionnal skills are good ... or not !

Thanks for reading this, and I hope you liked my code (and CV content of course...)
